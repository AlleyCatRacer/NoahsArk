# SEP_S21
Written as a 2nd semester project in spring 2021 for software engineering at VIA university college, campus Horsens, DK.

The project requirements was to write a multi-user relational database management system in Java and the database with PostrgreSQL. The development must be Agile and the system tested with JUnit.
