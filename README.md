# Noah's Ark
Written as a 2<sup>nd</sup> semester project in spring 2021 for software engineering at [VIA university college](https://via.dk), campus Horsens, DK.  
The idea was to create a public platform where canine enthusiast could post and answer questions in forums as well as advertise their services and search through services provided by other users.


## Development
The project requirements were to create a multi-user relational database management system in Java and the database in PostrgreSQL. The development must be Agile, the methodology must be Scrum and the system must be tested with JUnit.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GUI was created with FXML files generated from SceneBuilder, the Java code was written in IntelliJ IDEA and the postgreSQL code was written in DataGrip.

The semester project group consisted of 4 people:
