VALUES('Dogs: Our best friends in sickness and in health','Dogs, often hailed as humans’ best friends, have been the topic of many scientific studies looking into how they might boost our well-being. In this Spotlight, we’ll explain how your friendly pup can benefit your health across the board.According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), an estimated 78 million dogs are owned as pets in the United States. It is unclear when dogs were first domesticated, but a studyTrusted Source published last year claims that, at least in Europe, dogs were tamed 20,000–40,000 years ago.It is likely that humans and dogs have shared a special bond of friendship and mutual support ever since at least the Neolithic period — but why has this bond been so long-lasting? Of course, these cousins of the wolves have historically been great at keeping us and our dwellings safe, guarding our houses, our cattle, and our various material goods. Throughout history, humans have also trained dogs to assist them with hunting, or they have bred numerous quirky-looking species for their cuteness or elegance. However, dogs are also — and might have always been — truly valued companions, famed for their loyalty and seemingly constant willingness to put a smile on their owners’ faces. In this Spotlight, we outline the research that shows how our dogs make us happier, more resilient when facing stress, and physically healthier, to name but a few ways in which these much-loved quadrupeds support our well-being.');

VALUES ('Dogs make people feel good','It is really difficult not to cheer up, even after a hard day’s work, when you are greeted with — often vocal — enthusiasm by a friendly dog. This, researchers explain, is due to the effect of the “love hormone” oxytocin. “During the last decades,” write the authors of a review that featured in Frontiers in Psychology, “animal assistance in therapy, education, and care has greatly increased.” When we interact with dogs, our oxytocin levels shoot up. Since this is the hormone largely responsible for social bonding, this hormonal “love injection” boosts our psychological well-being. Previous studies analyzed in the review have revealed that dog owners have more positive social interactions, and that the presence of canine friends makes people more trusting…and also more deserving of trust. Moreover, dogs appear to reduce symptoms of depression and render people more resilient to stress. That is why dogs are often used as therapy animals. As researcher Brian Hare, of Duke University in Durham, NC, noted in an interview for The Washington Post: “Dogs make people feel good, and their only job is to help people in stressful situations feel better.” Researchers hypothesize that therapy dogs can improve the psychological well-being of children going through cancer therapy, as well as help individuals diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) deal with disruptive symptomsTrusted Source or even prevent the onset of PTSD episodes.');

Howling, along with barking, whining and other noises is simply one way that dogs have of communicating with each other, and us. Dogs howl to make their presence known and to mark their territory. Dogs also may howl for attention, or wail as a response to loud or high-pitched noises, like an ambulance siren. Sadly for fantasy lovers, howling has nothing to do with the full moon; it’s just your dog’s way of saying (loudly), “Hello!”','Behavior');

Either they want something, or they are trying to figure out what you want. In the first scenario, it might be food, or a treat, a walk, or playtime. In the second, you could be training, or you might’ve said something your pup doesn’t understand, and he’s working hard to try to find the meaning in your expression.','Behavior');

values ('Why Does My Dog Eat Poop?','While poop-eating may seem gross to us, to dogs, it comes from total instinct. When a mama dog has a litter of puppies in the wild, she cleans up after their little poops the only way she can, by eating them. Not only does this keep her den clean; it also protects her puppies from nearby predators, who could be drawn in by the smell. Puppies often learn this behavior from mom, as it coincides well with their natural curiosity and desire to smell and taste EVERYTHING. While most pups grow out of this habit, some dogs eat poop as adults out of boredom, a lack of proper nutrition, or a lack of training against the behavior.','Behavior');

values ('What Vaccinations Should My Dog Have?','Just like vaccinations for humans, immunization shots for dogs fall into two categories: necessary and optional. While laws vary by state, dogs are usually required to have an annual rabies vaccine, to prevent the spread of this dangerous disease. The ASPCA includes the rabies vaccine as a part of the core vaccines: those recommended by most vets for ALL dogs. The other core vaccines are:1.Canine Parvovirus, 2.Distemper Virus, 3.Adenovirus-2. Non-Core, or optional vaccines, include Bordetella, Lyme disease, Leptospirosis, and canine influenza, among others. While these are optional legally, and may not be recommended for all dogs, most canine boarding facilities and dog parks require all visiting pups to receive Bordetella vaccines in addition to core vaccines at least once per year (some need Bordetella once every six months).  Before bringing your dog to a daycare or dog park, be sure to go over the vaccination requirements, and talk to your vet about the best way to keep your dog safe from disease.','Before Adopting');

Whereas it’s normal for puppies to poop up to five times a day, adult dogs need to go number two less frequently. There are some basic rules of thumb about poop frequency. In general, a dog should move their bowels at least once a day. Many will go two or three times a day on the regular. But if you have a dog that is pooping more than three times a day, don’t panic! As long as your dog’s stool is solid, of an even consistency, and doesn’t contain blood, that’s probably normal for them. In fact, young dogs like puppies, frequently poop more than three times a day due to a high metabolism, a large intake of food, and squeaky clean intestines. ','Before Adopting');

Just like in humans, dogs are prone to tartar and plaque, which can build up and travel below the gum line, causing gingivitis, periodontitis, and in extreme cases, blood infections. It’s estimated that by two years old, most dogs will have some form of dental disease, but this is easily preventable when you brush your dog’s teeth regularly and take them to the vet for annual exams and cleanings.

How often you bathe your dog depends on your dog’s breed. For example, hairless breeds need the most bathing, with hairless dogs needing a bath once a week to keep their skin healthy. Furred dogs and long-haired dogs don’t need to be bathed as often, as long as you are brushing your dog’s coat regularly. A good bath every 4-6 weeks should be enough to keep their coat shiny and healthy.','Everyday Care');

Most dogs bark to alert their owners or other dogs about something interesting, whether it’s a squirrel or deer, a car, or the mail person. Teaching your dog not to bark can include several different methods. Positive reinforcement training teaches dogs to ignore outside distractions by rewarding your dog for quiet behavior, such as passing another dog on the street without barking. The pup quickly learns that being quiet earns a treat, while barking gets them nothing.','Training');

values ('How Do I Teach My Dog To Sit? ','Choose a quiet place in your home to enable the dog to concentrate. Start with the dog near to you and facing you - you may consider using a lead for more control, if the dog is inclined to wander off. Get your dog’s attention by using their name. Make sure that you have something in your hand that your dog wants, such as a treat or toy, and place that hand just above your dog’s nose. Move your hand slowly in an arc, up and back over your dog’s head so that the dog follows it with his nose, and as their head goes up, their bottom will come down to the floor - like a seesaw. As soon as your dog sits – they need rewarding for doing the right thing, so say ‘yes’, smile at them, praise them with your voice, stroke them, whilst also giving them the treat or a game with the toy. Once your dog has the idea of sitting when you move your hand over their head with the treat lure, place your treat or toy in your other hand, but otherwise repeat everything you did before, so the dog is learning to perform the behaviour on a hand signal alone. Once the dog is reliably performing the sit when you move your hand back over their head, start using the word ‘sit’, just before the hand movement. After a few repetitions, begin to reduce the hand movement, so that the dog is learning to be able to perform the sit just when you say the word ‘sit’. Fade the hand signal out altogether by saying the word ‘sit’ and just waiting a second for your dog to sit. If they don''t, they are not yet ready for the hand signal to be removed altogether. Be ready to back up the word ''sit'' with the hand signal, to ensure your dog still gets it right, so the dog is learning to perform the behaviour on a verbal cue. To teach the dog to sit longer - keep the smile and verbal praise going, but withhold the treat or toy for a second or two until you are ready, not forgetting the release word ‘yes’ or ‘ok’ as you give them. Don’t push your dog too far too fast. Just aim for a few seconds at a time only – you don’t want your dog to get up before you are ready to release them. To teach the dog to sit still when you are short distance away from them, start taking a step or two away from them, immediately returning to reward them in position. To make it more difficult, start increasing the distractions around your dog or change your position in relation to your dog, or by asking them to sit when out in your garden or on a walk. You may have to go back to the beginning and re-teach with these changes. To make the sit really useful, re-teach in a variety of environments until the dog really gets the idea that the word ‘sit’ means the same wherever they are, and that they should stay in the sit position until released – you can really have some fun with this, with a bit of imagination, which will help your control when out in public and faced with other dogs and people.','Training');
